Terms of Service

The gist:

We (the people who work at Minds) create open source software and run the Minds.com social network. We would love for you to use it and help us evolve this document in the direction that best protects Minds and its community. Public commentary and peer-review is encouraged via the Minds support group.  Minds basic services, to create a channel or launch a site on Minds.com, are free.  We also offer paid upgrades for advanced features and other commercial services. Minds software and services are designed to give you as much control and ownership over your social world as possible and encourage you to express yourself freely. However, be responsible in what you publish. In particular, make sure that none of the prohibited items listed below appear on your site or get linked to/from your site (things like spam, malware, viruses, or illegal content or serious threats of violence).
If you find a Minds.com channel or site that you believe violates these Terms of Service, please email this information to info@minds.com.
(Note, we’ve decided to make the below Terms of Service available under a Creative Commons Sharealike license, as Wordpress provided for us.) which means you’re more than welcome to repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to replace references to us with ones to you, and if you don’t mind we’d appreciate a link to Minds.com somewhere on your website.

If you create an account on the Minds platform, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your channel or your site, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the channel and any other actions taken in connection with the channel or site. You must not describe or assign keywords to your channel or network in a misleading or unlawful manner, including in a manner intended to trade on the name or reputation of others, and Minds may change or remove any description or keyword that it considers unlawful or otherwise likely to cause Minds liability.

By submitting Content to Minds, you grant Minds a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing, and promoting your channel or site. You also give other Minds users permission to share your Content on other Minds channels and sites and add their own Content to it ((aka to Remind (reblog) your Content)), so long as they use only a portion of your post, and they give you credit as the original author by linking back to your website. The Remind function on Minds.com does this automatically. If you delete Content, Minds will use reasonable efforts to remove it from Minds, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, Minds has the right (though not the obligation) to, in Minds’ sole discretion, (i) refuse or remove any Content that, in Minds’ reasonable opinion, violates any Minds terms or policies or is in any way unlawful or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of Minds to any individual or entity. Minds will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid, regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio file, or computer software.

The downloading, copying and use of the Content will not infringe the proprietary rights, including but not limited to the copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret rights, of any third party;
If your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you have either (i) received permission from your employer to post or make available the Content, including but not limited to any software, or (ii) secured from your employer a waiver as to all rights in or to the Content;
You represent that you have fully complied with any third-party licenses relating to the Content, and have done all things necessary to successfully pass through to end users any required terms;
The Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content;
The Content is not spam or bulk unsolicited messages, is not machine or randomly generated, and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing);

You also give other Minds user’s permission to share your Content under the legal terms outlined in the license you select, whether Creative Commons, All Rights Reserved, or any other available license;

You also may not use Minds logos, marks or make reference to, or make false representation or impersonation of Minds without the expressed written permission of Minds, Inc..
Payment and Renewal.

General Terms.  

Minds offers optional paid services such as hosting, subscriptions, monetization, additional storage, bandwidth, video transcoding, and Boost (any such services, an “Upgrade”). By an Upgrade you agree to pay Minds the monthly or annual subscription fees indicated for that service. Payments will be charged on a pre-pay basis on the day you sign up for an Upgrade and will cover the use of that service for a monthly or annual subscription period as indicated. You can read about our refund policy here.
Automatic Renewal. 
Unless you notify Minds before the end of the applicable subscription period that you want to cancel an Upgrade, your Upgrade subscription will automatically renew and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable annual or monthly subscription fee for such Upgrade (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you. Upgrades can be canceled at any time in the admin section of your website’s dashboard.
Additional Users. Minds will calculate your site hosting charge based on Monthly Active Users (MAU) calculated as the peak number of unique active users who have initiated at least one session over a one month period. 
Minds Services. Consulting and support services are provided by Minds under the terms and conditions for each such service engagement. Please contact info@minds.com for more information.

If you believe that material located on or linked to by Minds violates your copyright, you are encouraged to notify Minds in accordance with Minds’ DIgital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) Policy. Minds will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material. Minds will terminate a visitor’s access to and use of Minds if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of Minds or others. In the case of such termination, Minds will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to Minds.

8. Changes

We are constantly updating our services, and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our services are offered.

The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new Terms will take effect.
