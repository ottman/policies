Your privacy is important to us, and it is Minds, Inc. (Minds) policy to respect the privacy of our users regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

Users have the right to be anonymous on Minds. Minds does not require any personally identifiable information to sign up. However, unless users provide a valid email address they will be unable to utilize certain services such as Forgot Password, and there will be no way to recover an account.

Minds is encrypted end-to-end via HTTPS and encrypts and/or hashes all sensitive information stored while in motion or at rest including emails, passwords and private messages.

Minds does not ask you for personal information unless it is required to provide certain additional services including but not limited to payments, two-factor authentication, etc..

Minds does not willfully disclose the personal information of our users to anyone except to comply to applicable law, provide the services of the website, or protect our rights. In regards to applicable law, Minds will only respond to authorized and written requests and will resist unconstitutional requests for personal information. Minds will notify users immediately if we believe their personal information is disclosed in any unauthorized way.

Website Visitors

Minds encourages anonymity and has a mission to become free from all dependencies on third-party, proprietary software and infrastructure. Minds does not store any personally identifiable information unless it is hashed or encrypted. Minds does currently utilize certain third-party services and tools which may collect personally identifiable information such as IP addresses To improve your anonymity, Minds recommends use of privacy tools and browsers such as Tor. 

Like most website operators, Minds collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Minds’ purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Minds’ visitors use its website. From time to time, Minds may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Minds’ websites choose to interact with Minds in ways that require Minds to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Minds gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Minds are occasionally asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Minds collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Minds. Minds does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Open Data

Minds may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Minds may monitor the most popular channels or sites.

Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Minds discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Minds’ behalf or to provide services available at Minds’ websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using MInds’ websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Minds discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Minds believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Minds, third parties or the public at large.

Minds takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
